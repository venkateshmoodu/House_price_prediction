# House Price Prediction:

# Machine learning model to predict house price using linear regression
# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a machine learning model, specifically a Linear Regression model. The model aims to establish a relationship between various housing features (such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and other relevant factors) and the house price.

By analyzing these features, the model predicts the price of a house, which is essential for buyers, sellers, and real estate agencies to make informed decisions.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is USA_Housing.csv. It contains the following columns:

Avg. Area Income: The average income of residents in the area.
Avg. Area House Age: The average age of houses in the area.
Avg. Area Number of Rooms: The average number of rooms for houses in the area.
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: The average number of bedrooms for houses in the area.
Area Population: The population of the area.
Price: The price of the house (this is the dependent variable we are trying to predict).
Algorithms and Methods Used
# 1. Linear Regression:
Purpose: Linear regression is used to predict a target variable (house price) based on one or more input features (like the number of bedrooms, square footage, etc.).
Working: The model assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target. The objective is to minimize the difference between the predicted house price and the actual price (also called the residual or error).

# 2. Train-Test Split:
Purpose: To avoid overfitting and to evaluate the performance of the model, the data is split into two sets:
Training Set: The model is trained on this set (usually 80% of the data).
Testing Set: The model is evaluated on this set (usually 20% of the data).
# 3. Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, without considering their direction.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This is the square root of the MSE, providing an error measure in the same units as the target variable.
Steps Followed in the Project
Data Preprocessing:

# Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Checked for missing values and handled them (if any).
Visualized the dataset to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable (Price).
# Feature Selection:

The independent variables used are Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, and Area Population.
The target variable is Price.
# Model Building:

Used Linear Regression from the sklearn library to train the model.
# Model Evaluation:

After training the model, the predictions were evaluated using MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
# Results Visualization:

Plotted the results of the predictions vs. actual house prices to visualize the performance of the model.
Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features. By leveraging machine learning, it simplifies the process of estimating house prices, aiding in real estate decision-making.
